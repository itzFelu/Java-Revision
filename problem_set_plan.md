üí° Assignment / Problem Set Ideas
---------------------------------

Here are problems you can implement locally. Try to cover a range of topics. I‚Äôve grouped them by difficulty so you can build up.

### Easy / Basic Level

1.  **Hello / Setup**
    
    *   Print ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù
        
    *   Print with no newline / with space separators / formatted output.
        
2.  **Arithmetic & Control Flow**
    
    *   Swap two numbers (with and without a temporary variable).
        
    *   Compute factorial of a number.
        
    *   Sum of first _N_ natural numbers; sum of even/odd numbers up to N.
        
    *   Check if a number is prime.
        
    *   Check leap year.
        
    *   FizzBuzz (for numbers 1..N, print ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù for multiples of 3, ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù for 5, etc.).
        
3.  **Strings & Arrays**
    
    *   Reverse a string; check if palindrome.
        
    *   Find first non‚Äêrepeating character in a string.
        
    *   Count vowels and consonants.
        
    *   Anagram checker for two strings.
        
    *   Linear search in an array; find maximum, minimum.
        
    *   Sort an array using bubble sort / selection sort.
        
4.  **Pattern Printing**
    
    *   Print simple star / number patterns: triangle, pyramid.
        
    *   Pascal‚Äôs triangle.
        

### Intermediate Level

1.  **Object‚ÄêOriented / OOPs**
    
    *   Create a Person class with fields (name, age, address), methods, getters/setters.
        
    *   Extend Person to Student and Teacher, override some behavior.
        
    *   Interface: define an interface Shape with method area(), perimeter(); implement for Circle, Rectangle, etc.
        
    *   Implement method overloading & constructor overloading.
        
2.  **Collections & Generics**
    
    *   Given a list of integers, remove duplicates using Set.
        
    *   Sort a list of custom objects (e.g. students by grade) using Comparator / Comparable.
        
    *   Use Map to count frequency of words in a paragraph.
        
3.  **Exception Handling & File I/O**
    
    *   Write code that reads a file line by line; catch possible exceptions.
        
    *   Custom exception: create your own exception (e.g. InvalidAgeException) and use it.
        
4.  **Searching & Sorting / Algorithms**
    
    *   Binary search on a sorted array.
        
    *   Merge sort / Quick sort.
        
    *   Find kth largest / smallest element.
        

### Advanced / Project‚ÄêStyle

1.  **Mini Projects**
    
    *   **Library Management System**Classes: Book, User, Librarian etc. Methods to issue, return, search books.
        
    *   **Banking System**Accounts (savings/cheque), interface for transactions, overdraft, interest calculation, exception handling for insufficient funds.
        
    *   **Contact Management**CRUD operations for contacts stored in a file; search by name, phone, sort contacts.
        
2.  **Concurrency / More Advanced Core Features**
    
    *   Multithreading: create a program with two threads, one printing even numbers, the other odd. Synchronize access if needed.
        
    *   Generics & Wildcards in depth.
        
    *   Lambda expressions + Streams: e.g. given list of employees filter by salary, sort by age, map to names.
